## Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here’s a little about me:

---

### 🎯 I’m currently working on  
Too many things at once – usually something with TypeScript, Angular, C#, or Kubernetes.  
And yeah, sometimes I just build stuff to see if it works.

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 I’m looking to collaborate on  
Small tools, fun ideas, nerdy side projects.  
If you’ve got something worth tinkering with – hit me up!

### 🤝 I’m looking for help with  
UX for complex stuff or just finding people to nerd out and build things together without stressing over perfection.

### 🌱 I’m currently learning  
AI integrations for business processes and how to spend less time lost in admin UI mazes.

### 💬 Ask me about  
How to survive legacy code with dignity and why refactoring can be deeply rewarding <br>
how I accidentally learned more about device lifecycle management than I ever planned to<br>
or why I think complexity is underrated (as long as *you* understand it 🙃).
